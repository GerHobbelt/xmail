CHANGE LOG

  Jun 27, 2009 v 1.26

    *   Fixed a bug where STARTTLS was resetting the session too much, by
        canceling certain flags/options read inside the SERVER.TAB.

    *   Fixed a bug that happened if a message filter mistakenly remove the
        message file from under XMail control.

    *   Fixed a bug that make XMail to wrongly report virtual memory sizes
        on 32 bit systems with larger than 4GB VM space.

    *   Changed the line termination used to store messages into the
        mailboxes of Unix versions of XMail. Now messages are stored with
        the OS native LF termination, instead of the RFC CRLF that was used
        before. This allows other Unix softwares working together with XMail
        to not be confused by the extra CR present in the line termination.

    *   The "smtprelay" behaviour with respect to 5xx responses from one of
        the servers in the relay list, has been changed. Now a 5xx response
        will stop the processing, instead of iterating on the remaining
        servers of the list.

    *   Avoid to crawl all the USER.TAB file during a "userlist" CTRL
        command.

    *   Fixed a bug that allowed non-RFC characters inside domain names.

    *   Fixed OSX Leopard build error.

    *   Added "timeo" option to flags execution.

    *   Added "NoAuth", "EnableVRFY" and "EnableETRN" settings inside IP
        properties.

  Jan 3, 2008 v 1.25

    *   Added the ability to select SmtpConfig-IP options by local port too
        (SmtpConfig-IP,PORT).

    *   Added a new -YT command line option to set the timeout used by a
        POP3 client connection.

    *   Fixed a bug in the RFC822 ATEXT token definition.

    *   If the recipient domain does not have an MX record, and does not
        have an A record, now XMail bounces immediately.

    *   Fixed OpenSSL connection shutdown to avoid RST packet generation.

    *   Changed SMTP AUTH LOGIN authentication to support the optional
        inline parameter.

    *   Added IPV6 support. New command line options are available to select
        XMail's behaviour with respect to IPV4/IPV6 compatibility.

    *   Fixed/strengthened RFC address parsing.

    *   Drop the SMTP connection is case of timeout.

    *   Fixed a bug caused by the new strict host/doman name check added in
        1.24 (in the SMTPGW.TAB parsing).

    *   Completely changed the DNS resolution code.

    *   Do not try the A-record delivery in case of temporary DNS/network
        errors.

    *   Added remote MTA message ID to SMAIL logging.

    *   Added a new "POP3S" option to the POP3LINKS.TAB file, to allow
        connections to full POP3S remote servers.

    *   Fixed a bug in the SMTP Outbind feature.

    *   Changed POP3 log format to add information about the success or
        failure of the operation, and to report the number of messages and
        the total size of the mailbox (in case of successful login).

    *   Added a new "Pop3LogPasswd" SERVER.TAB variable to control if POP3
        passwords are logged into the POP3 log file.

    *   Added a new "SmtpNoTLSAuths" SERVER.TAB variable. It allows to
        specify which SMTP authentications are allowed in non-TLS mode.

    *   Fixed a small memory leak affecting users using the "OutBind"
        feature.

    *   Removed the "SMTP-TLS" SERVER.TAB variable and replaced with
        "SmtpGwConfig" that supports the format described in "SMTP GATEWAY
        CONFIGURATION". The "SmtpGwConfig" allows the user to specify global
        options for remote SMTP connections.

    *   Added $(RRCPT) macro to SMTP filters.

  Jan 1, 2007 v 1.24

        specify the IP of the interface to be used when talking to the
        remote server.

    *   Added a new "OutBind" option to the "SmtpConfig" SERVER.TAB
        variables. It allows to specify the IP of the interface to be used
        when talking to the remote server.

    *   Added a new SMTP.HNPROP.TAB file to drive remote peers SMTP
        properties through host name.

         ********************************************************************

    *   Added the new "Leave" options for PSYNC accounts, that allows
        messages to be left on the remote server. This option only works if
        the remote POP3 server supports the UIDL command.

    *   Fixed a bug in the mailbox size check between SMTP and SMAIL layers.
        This resulted in EFULL errors never returned at SMTP level.

    *   Fixed a bug in alias resolution for aliased users inside aliased
        domains.

    *
         ********************************************************************

         ********************************************************************
         * The format of the "DefaultSMTPGateways" SERVER.TAB variable, of the
         * SMTPFWD.TAB relay list, and of the "smtprelay" list changed
         * (separator is now the ';' character and can have options attached,
         * separated by comma).
         * You need to adjust it according to the new format
         ********************************************************************

    *   Added new "EnableCTRL-TLS", "EnableSMTP-TLS" and "EnablePOP3-TLS"
        SERVER.TAB variables.

    *   Added SMTP gateway options to the "DefaultSMTPGateways" variable, to
        the SMTPFWD.TAB file, and to the "smtprelay" command inside the mail
        processing files.

        Added a new "WantTLS" option to the "SmtpConfig" SERVER.TAB
        variables.

    *   Added a new "EaseTLS" option to the SMTP.IPPROP.TAB file.

    *   Added a new 'S' SMTP auth option to bypass a "WantTLS"
        configuration.

    *   Added "SSLUseCertsFile", "SSLUseCertsDir", "SSLWantVerify",
        "SSLAllowSelfSigned", "SSLWantCert" and "SSLMaxCertsDepth"
        SERVER.TAB variables to configure XMail's SSL behaviour.

    *   Added SMTPS support.

    *   Added POP3S support.

    *   Added CTRLS support.

    *   Added FAPOP, STLS and FSTLS authentication options to the
        POP3LINKS.TAB file..

    *   Added a new "SMTP-TLS" SERVER.TAB variable to tell XMail if it has
        to try to negotiate TLS sessions with remote SMTP servers.

    *   Added SSL support to the CTRL protocol and to the CtrlClnt client.

  Nov 19, 2006 v 1.23

    *   Changed the filter log to include the full exec string (separated by
        semicolon).

    *   Fix CTRL "poplnkadd" and "poplnkdel" to accept local domains strings
        starting with special characters.

    *   Added (finally!) a command line makefile (Makefile.win) to build the
        whole XMail package without the usage of the MS VC++ IDE.

    *   Reject a CTRL "domainadd" command if an alias domain already exists
        with the same name.

    *   Changed the CTRL "usergetmproc" command to allow the caller to
        specify if it is the user or the domain one that is wanted. Or a
        merges of both, if "DU" is specified in the optional 3th parameter.

    *   Changed the CTRL "usersetmproc" command to allow the caller to
        specify if it is the user ('U') or the domain ('D') one that is
        wanted to be set.

    *   Added complex/multiple macro substitution capabilities to external
        programs argoument lists.

    *   Added strictier SMTP address validation.

    *   Check the mailbox size for every message coming into the mailbox
        (before it was only done during the SMTP phase).

    *   Do not try to send to the 'A' record if the recipient domain does
        not exist at all (NXDOMAIN). Bounce immediately instead, avoiding
        lengthy retry policies.

    *   Added the "wlex" flag to filter lines (works for the SMTP ones
        only), to exclude execution of the filter line in case the client IP
        is white-listed inside the ipprop file.

    *   Added the post-RCPT SMTP filter, that is called before XMail acks
        the client recipient. A new "RCPT=EFILTER" long entry is emitted in
        case a recipient is rejected by a filter.

    *   Added @@CRCPT (current recipient) and @@FROM (sender email address)
        macros to SMTP filter substitution.

    *   Allow cmdaliases to work on aliased domains. Before a cmdalias
        defined on an alias-target domain was not working before the
        cmdalias check was done before the alias domain resolution.

    *   Added the ability to bypass the SMTP.IPMAP.TAB inclusion using SMTP
        authentication.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable "SMTP-IpMapDropCode" to control the
        drop code to be used for IPs listed inside the SMTP.IPMAP.TAB. Like
        other codes inside XMail, 1 means drop now, 0 means allow if auth,
        and -N means add N seconds delay. An immediate drop will emit a
        "SNDRIP=EIPBAN" log entry.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable "SmtpMsgIPBan" to control the SMTP
        message returned in case of SMTP.IPMAP.TAB inclusion.

    *   Added log message when the maximum number of SMTP/POP3/CTRL threads
        is hit.

    *   Fixed documentation about the spool info line and the SMTP filters
        info line.

    *   Fixed a build problem on OpenBSD related to the lack of c_r
        (reentrant C library) library.

    *   Fixed greetings message to be RFC2821 compliant (server host must be
        first).

    *   Fixed a NAME_MAX build error ond *BSD and Solaris.

    *   Added a "Pop3ScanCur" USER.TAB variable to control the scan of the
        Maildir's "cur" directory during POP3 message list build. Now XMail
        only scans the "new" directory as default.

  Oct 12, 2005 v 1.22

    *   The POP3 before SMTP authentication is now correctly interpreted as
        real SMTP authentication, by the mean of @@USERAUTH.

    *   'ATTENTION': Fixed a possible cause of buffer overflow in the
        XMail's sendmail binary.

    *   Changed the DNS MX resolution to allow better handling of partially
        broken DNS servers configuations.

  Jan 9, 2005 v 1.21

    *   Added a fix for 64 bits porting compatibility.

    *   Added the ability to exclude filters from execution in case of
        authenticated user. By pre-pending the filter command token with a
        token containing "!aex", the filters won't be run if the user
        authenticated himself.

    *   Added @@USERAUTH macro even to standard in/out filters (before it
        was only defined for SMTP ones).

    *   Added a new "NoSenderBounce" variable inside the SERVER.TAB file, to
        enable XMail generated bounce messages to have the empty SMTP sender
        ('MAIL FROM:<>').

    *   Added a new "SMTP-MaxErrors" variable inside the SERVER.TAB file to
        set the maximum errors allowed in a single SMTP session (default
        zero, unlimited).

    *   Added a "LastLoginTimeDate" variable to the "userstat" CTRL command.

    *   Added external aliases support in the CTRL protocol.

    *   The MESSAGE.ID file is now automatically created, if missing.

    *   Changed the logic used to treat domain and user MAILPROC.TAB files.
        Before, a user's MAILPROC.TAB was overriding the domain one, while
        now the rules are merged together, with domain's ones first,
        followed by user's ones.

    *   The maximum mailbox size of zero is now interpreted as unlimited.

    *   Fixed XMail's sendmail to detect non-RFC822 data and handle it
        correctly.

    *   The IP:PORT addresses emission in spool files (and Received: lines)
        has been changed to the form [IP]:PORT.

    *   Added filter logging, that is enabled with the new -Qg command line
        option.

    *   Fixed an error message in the SMTP server, that was triggered by the
        remote client not using the proper syntax for the "MAIL FROM:" and
        "RCPT TO:" commands.

    *   Fixed explicit routing through SMTPGW.TAB file.

    *   Fixed a possible problem with file locking that might be triggered
        from CTRL commands cfgfileget/cfgfileset.

    *   Added a check to avoid the CTRL server to give an error when a
        domain created with older versions of XMail does not have the domain
        directory inside cmdaliases.

    *   The SMTP server FQDN variable should be set to the value of
        "SmtpServerDomain", when this is used inside the SERVER.TAB file.

  May 30, 2004 v 1.20

    *   Fixed a possible memory leak and a possible source of crashes.

  May 29, 2004 v 1.19

    *   Implemented the "filter" command for custom mail processing
        (MAILPROC.TAB, cmdaliases and custom domains).

    *   If "RemoveSpoolErrors" is set inside the SERVER.TAB file, messages
        are never frozen. Before there was a special case (delivery failure
        and delivery notification failure) that could have lead to frozen
        messages.

    *   Made "aliasdomainadd" to check for the existence of the alias domain
        (and reject the command if existing).

    *   Introduced a new environment variable recognized by XMail
        (XMAIL_PID_DIR), to let the user to specify a custom PID file
        directory (this is for Unix ports only).

    *   Implemented ability to stop custom mail processing upon certain exit
        codes from external commands execution.

    *   The SPAMMERS.TAB check is now bypassable (see doc for details).

    *   'ATTENTION': Changed the "aliasdomainlist" syntax and output format
        (see doc for details).

    *   Made (on Unix setups) the PID file name to be dependent on the
        daemon file name.

    *   Implemeted a domain-wise MAILPROC.TAB and extended its "redirect"
        and "lredirect" commands to support account specific (USER@DOMAIN)
        and domain targets (DOMAIN).

    *   Implemented SMTP filters to allow users to reject the SMTP session
        before and after the remote client data has been received.

  Mar 27, 2004 v 1.18

    *   Restructured the external program execution environment on Unix
        ports. Simplified, as a consequence of this, the system dependent
        portion of XMail (SysDep*).

    *   Fixed a bug in the address range parsing (x.y.w.z/s).

    *   Fixed the alias lookup to perform a better "best match" wildcard
        selection.

    *   Fixed a bug in the DNS resolved that made XMail to not correctly
        handle domain CNAMEs.

  Sep 14, 2003 v 1.17

    *   Added Bcc: removal from message headers in XMail's sendmail.

    *   Added PSYNC logging (-Yl).

    *   Added domain completion to XMail's sendmail when the specified
        sender address (-f or -F) does not contain one. The environment
        variable (or registry in Windows) DEFAULT_DOMAIN is looked up to try
        to complete the address.

    *   Fixed a bug in the return code of SysAccept() in all Unix versions.

    *   Fixed a bug that was triggered by external command and filter
        exiting soon. XMail was not able to correctly sync with the child
        process by losing it. This apply only to Unix versions of XMail.

    *   A notification message is now sent to the sender if the message is
        handled with "smtp" or "smtprelay" commands and a permanent error
        happen when sending to the remote SMTP server.

  Jul 8, 2003 v 1.16

    *   Added a new configuration file "smtp.ipprop.tab" to be able to
        specify peer IP based configuration option, like for example IP
        white listing against IP checks.

    *   'ATTENTION': The filter return code has been changed and new return
        codes are expected to be returned by filters. Please che the
        documentation and update your filters before starting to use the new
        version.

    *   Added the ability to specify a custom error message for filters.

    *   Fixed a bug in the string quoting function that showed up when the
        string was empty ("").

    *   Changed the order used by XMail to check the mailer domain. Now MX
        check is performed first, then A record check. This caused a slow
        down for domains having MX records but not A records.

    *   Added two new Received: types to give the ability to hide client
        information if the SMTP client does authenticate with the server.

    *   Added the rejection map name inside the SMTP log file in case of
        SNDRIP=EIPMAP error.

    *   Modified XMail's sendmail to add the RFC822 Date: header if missing.

    *   XMail now uses the name of the executable ( without .exe ) to both
        register the service name and fetch registry variables.

    *   The POP3 server now picks up messages even from the Maildir's "cur"
        subdirectory.

  May 3, 2003 v 1.15

    *   Implemented a new filters feature that enable the user to stop the
        selected filters list processing upon receival of certain exit
        codes.

    *   Fixed the wrong log file name generation when the daylight time is
        active.

    *   Fixed a bug inside the DNS MX resolver.

    *   Fixed a bug ( Windows OS bug ) that made XMail unable to create
        domains starting with reserved device names ( COM#, LPT, PRN, CON,
        ... ). So, for example, a domain named "com4.domain.org" couldn't be
        created because of this naming conflict.

    *   Fixed a bug that made XMail to not apply filters for local mailing
        list.

    *   Fixed a bug that made XMail to crash under certain conditions.

  April 2, 2003 v 1.14

    *   Added a "Server:" field to the notification message. It'll report
        the remote SMTP server host name and IP that issued the error. It
        will not be present if the error does not originate from a remote
        SMTP server.

    *   Added a new command line parameter -MD to set the number of
        subdirectories allocated for the DNS cache files storage.

    *   Messages with non RFC822 conforming headers are now handled by the
        PSYNC code.

    *   'ATTENTION': The filter architecture has been completely changed. To
        correctly update to this version you have to create two empty files
        "filters.in.tab" and "filters.out.tab" inside the $MAIL_ROOT
        directory. Please refer to the documentation for more information
        about the new filter architecture. If you are not currently using
        filters, the simple creation of the two files listed above will be
        sufficent.

    *   'ATTENTION': The internal spool file format is changed with the new
        line added ( the 1st one ) that contain various message information.
        Filters that rely on the internal spool file format must be changed
        to match the new structure.

    *   Fixed a bug that made XMail to not correctly report zero sized files
        inside the mailbox.

    *   Added file size to CTRL's "filelist" command.

    *   Fixed a connect-error reporting bug on Windows platform.

  January 25, 2003 v 1.12

    *   Better check for user/domain names.

    *   Changed search pattern for filters. Now a domain name is scanned for
        all sub-domains.

    *   Fixed a boundary check inside the Base64 decoder.

    *   Added the client FQDN inside the SMTP log file in case the RDNS
        check is enabled.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable "SmtpMsgIPBanSpammers" to set the
        message that is sent to the SMTP client when the client IP is listed
        inside the file SPAMMER.TAB.

        = item *

        Added a new SERVER.TAB variable "SmtpMsgIPBanMaps" to set the
        message that is sent to the SMTP client when the client IP is listed
        inside one of the "CustMapsList".

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable "SmtpMsgIPBanSpamAddress" to set the
        message that is sent to the SMTP client when the client IP is listed
        inside the file SPAM-ADDRESS.TAB.

    *   Fixed a bug inside the custom account handling that made XMail to
        pass the old password instead of the new one.

    *   Added OpenBSD support.

  November 9, 2002 v 1.11

    *   Added a new command line parameter -QT to enable a configurable
        timeout for filter commands.

    *   Fixed a bug that made XMail to ignore cmdalias accounts when a
        wildcard alias was matching the account itself.

    *   Added the 'smtprelay' command to the MAILPROC.TAB processing.

    *   Removed the 'wait' command from all custom processing.

    *   Added a new macro @@RRCPT to filters commands to extract the real
        local recipient.

    *   Changed the way the EXTALIASES.TAB mapping modify the return path.
        It now change the "Reply-To:" instead of the "From:" to avoid
        problems with signature verification software.

    *   Implemented logging on SMTP transactions rejected because of mapped
        IP or failing RDNS check.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable "SmtpServerDomain" to force the SMTP
        domain used by XMail in its banner string ( for CRAM-MD5 ESMTP
        authentication ).

    *   Improved DNS resolution for not existing domains.

    [top]

  July 27, 2002 v 1.10

    *   Added a variable 'CustomSMTPMessage' inside the server's
        configuration file SERVER.TAB to enable the postmaster to set a
        custom message that is appended to the standard XMail error
        response.

    *   Added log entries in case of relay lists mapped IPs.

    *   Fixed a build error on FreeBSD.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable 'DisableEmitAuthUser' to block the
        emission the the header 'X-Auth-User:' for authenticated user.

    *   Added a new USER.TAB variable 'DisableEmitAuthUser' to block the
        emission the the header 'X-Auth-User:' for authenticated users (this
        variable overrides the SERVER.TAB one).

    *   Added command line driven mailbox delivery mode (-MM = Maildir , -Mm
        = mailbox).

    *   Added sysv_inst.sh shell script to help creating SysV boot scripts
        for XMail.

    [top]

  June 15, 2002 v 1.9

    *   Fixed a bug in HOSTNAME:PORT handing code inside the PSYNC server.

    *   Fixed a bug introduced in 1.8 in the Windows version that made XMail
        to have bad behaviour when used with external programs.

    *   Fixed a bug that resulted in XMail generating frozen messages even
        if the SERVER.TAB variable was set to not create them.

    *   Fixed a bug that made it possible to send a 'MAIL
        FROM:<@localdomain:remoteaddress>' and to have the message relayed
        if the IP of the current machine was inside the smtprelay.tab of the
        machine handling the MX of @localdomain.

    *   Implemented internal mail loop checking (internal redirects).

    *   Added a new MLUSERS.TAB permissions flags 'A', that is similar to
        'W' by instead of checking the 'MAIL FROM:<...>' address check the
        SMTP authentication address (this will prevent malicious users to
        forge the address to gain write permissions on the list).

    [top]

  May 19, 2002 v 1.8

    *   Changed XMail's behaviour upon receival on long (RFC compared) data
        lines on SMTP and POP3 fetch inbound doors. Before the operation was

        impossible for attackers to guess the stack frame pointer.

    *   With this new feature, even if buffer overflows are present, the
        worst thing that could happen is a server crash and not the attacker
        that execute root code on the server machine.

    *   Implemented the SIZE ESMTP extension and introduced a new SERVER.TAB
        variable 'MaxMessageSize' that set the maximum message size that the

        version).

    *   Added the ability to specify a list of matching domains when using
        PSYNC with masquerading domains (see POP3LINKS.TAB section).

        from registry (Win32 version) and if it fails it reads from the
        environment.

    *   Fixed a bug that made XMail to crash if the first line of
        ALIASES.TAB was empty.

  April 29, 2001 v 0.71

    *   Removed the SERVER.TAB variable 'HeloUseRootDomain' and introduced a
        new one 'HeloDomain' to specify the name to send as HELO domain
        (look at variable documentation).

    *   If 'HeloDomain' is not specified or if empty then the reverse lookup
        of the local IP is sent as HELO domain.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable 'DUL-MAPSCheck' to implement the
        'dialups.mail-abuse.org' maps check.

    *   Changed the meaning of the SERVER.TAB variables SMTP-RDNSCheck,
        RBL-MAPSCheck, RSS-MAPSCheck, ORBS-MAPSCheck and DUL-MAPSCheck to
        give XMail the ability to delay SMTP commands for clients that fail
        the check.

    *   The old behaviour (dropped connection) is obtained by setting values
        greater than zero, while You can set the delay (in seconds) by
        specifying negative values.

    *   For SMTP-RDNSCheck and DUL-MAPSCheck variables the connection is no
        more dropped at welcome time but a 'server use forbidden' message is
        given at MAIL_FROM time.

    *   In this way XMail give authenticated users the ability to get in
        from 'mapped' IPs.

    *   Fixed a bug that cause XMail to crash if there is an empty line in a
        MLUSERS.TAB file.

        notification message for every message that has had delivery errors.

    *   The feature to force XMail to initiate a PSYNC transfer has been
        added. This is implemented by making XMail to check for a file named
        '.psync-trigger' inside MAIL_ROOT. When this file is found a PSYNC
        tranfer is started and the file is deleted.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable 'MaxMTAOps' to set the maximum
        number of relay steps before to declare the message as looped.

    *   Added SMTP after POP3 authentication and one new command line switch
        (-Se) to set the expire time of the POP3 IP.

        after POP3 authentication (EnableAuthSMTP-POP3).

    *   Added the replacement for sendmail that will use the local mail
        delivery of XMail (look at the sendmail section).

    *   The ESMTP command ETRN has been added has long as a new SMTP perm
        flag 'T' to give access to this feature and a new SERVER.TAB
        variable 'AllowSmtpETRN' to set the default feature access.

    *   Added a new CTRL command 'etrn' to support the same SMTP feature
        through the CTRL protocol.

    *   Fixed a bug in filters selection that made XMail to case-sensitive
        compare user and domain filters.

    *   Changed the name of the default filter to '.tab' instead of
        'defaultfilter.tab'.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB option 'HeloUseRootDomain' to make XMail to
        use the 'RootDomain' like HELO domain.

    *   Added FINGER service access control based on the peer IP address. A
        new file FINGER.IPMAP.TAB has been added to MAIL_ROOT with the same
        meaning of the ones used with SMTP, POP3 and CTRL services.

    *   Fixed a bug that caused XMail to drop the first character of the
        headers if there was no space between the colon and the header
        value.

    *   Added extended SMTP log information by adding an extra (last) field
        to the log file.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable 'AllowSmtpVRFY' (default off) to
        enable the SMTP VRFY command.

    *   Added a new SMTP auth flag 'V' to enable VRFY command (bypassing
        SERVER.TAB settings).

    *   Improved the POP3 sync method to fetch and distribute mail that uses
        an external POP3 mailbox to collect more accounts togheter. Before
        the method failed if the user was not in the first 'To:' address,
        while now all addresses contained in 'To:', 'Cc:' and 'Bcc:' are
        checked. There is also a new SERVER.TAB variable
        'Pop3SyncErrorAccount' whose use is catch all emails that has been
        fetched but has had delivery errors.

        disable files for non-local links.

    *   This will fix also a bug in multi-account and masquerading POP3
        sync.

    *   A new way to retrieve the POP3 domain has been coded by doing a
        reverse DNS lookup from the server IP. If the result of the lookup
        will be xxxx.yyyy.zzzz then XMail will test if xxxx.yyyy.zzzz is
        handled, then yyyy.zzzz and then zzzz.

    *   The first of these domains that is handled by XMail will be the POP3
        domain.

    *   Added a new SERVER.TAB variable 'CheckMailerDomain' that, if on
        ('1'), force XMail to validate the sender domain ('MAIL
        FROM:<...@xxx>') by looking up DNS/MX entries.

    *   Fixed the bug that made XMail to not accept users to add if a
        wildcard alias were defined.

    *   Improved MX records resolution and fixed a bug in MD5 algo.

    *   A new USER.TAB variable (for Mailing Lists) 'ListSender' has been
        added to hide real senders from SMTP protocol.

    *   If this variable does not exist the 'MAIL FROM:<>' command will
        contain the 'real' sender address.

    *   This variable should be set to the email address of the mailing list
        admin that will receive all the notification and error messages,
        preventing this error to reach real senders.

    *   Fixed an RFC conformance bug in SMTP protocol that made XMail to
        accept the MAIL_FROM command even if the HELO (or EHLO) command was
        not issued.

    *   Fixed a bug in SysExec() in Linux and Solaris versions that made all
        external programs to have a bad behaviour or fail. This bug was

    *   Complete Linux library rewrite, now using PThread library instead of
        forking.

    *   Solaris/SPARC port added (HPUX/PARISC incoming).

    *   Removed the -Ma flags for the maximum number of accounts coz it's no
        more needed due the new Linux system library (now the memory shares
        is given for free instead of having to rely on IPC).

    *   Removed the -Mk parameter due the IPC stuff removal.

    *   Extra domain aliases has been added (see ALIASES.TAB section).

        prepare mail files in a given format, put them in /spool/local
        directory and get them delivered by the server (see 'XMail local
        mailer' section).

    *   Two new directories 'local' and 'temp' must be created inside the
        'spool' directory.

    *   The meaning of the command line param '-Mr ...' has changed from
        days to hours.

    *   Added permissions to mailing list users (see MLUSERS.TAB section).
        This enable You to have read only users as long as read/write users.

    *   This is implemented by adding a new extra field to MLUSERS.TAB to
        store permissions ('R' or 'RW').

    *   The lack of this extra field (old MLUSERS.TAB files) will be
        interpreted as 'RW'.

    *   The command 'mluseradd' has been extended to hold the new permission
        parameter (see section 'XMail admin protocol').

  September 12, 2000 v 0.62

    *   Added a new custom domain processing command 'smtprelay' that can be
        used to route messages to other smtp servers (see section 'Custom
        domain mail processing').

    *   New search method for custdomains/ files : now the test to find out
        if the domain sub1.sub2.domain.net will get a custom domain
        processing is done by looking up sub1.sub2.domain.net.tab ,
        .sub2.domain.net.tab , .domain.net.tab , .net.tab and then .tab.

    *   There is a new POP3 sync method now that enables users that receives
        mail for multiple recipients into a single external POP3 account to
        get all mail to be distributed locally.

    *   You've to be sure, to not create mail loops, that all recipients
        domains are locally handled in a way or another (see section
        POP3LINKS.TAB).

        select the order of the try list (see section SMTPFWD.TAB).

    *   Added the random order option to 'smtprelay' custom domain
        processing (see section 'Custom domain mail processing').

        modules).

    *   A new file SMTPFWD.TAB has been introduced to supply customizable
        mail exchangers for external domains (see section SMTPFWD.TAB).

    *   Not local POP3 sync has been introduced to make it possible to
        download external POP3 accounts without having to setup local
        accounts (see section POP3LINKS.TAB).

    *   This feature can be used, for example, to catch mails from a set of
        remote accounts and redirect these to another SMTP server.

    *   Now it's possible to set per IP server port in command line params
        by specifying bindip[:port] PSYNC flags -Qx has been removed due the
        new queue system.

    *   A new global command line parameter -Mx has been introduced to setup
        the queue split level even if my suggestion is to leave the default
        value (23 , that means that the queue is splitted in 23 * 23 = 529
        subdirectories).

    *
         ********************************************************************    
         * A new spool format has been coded to enable XMail to handle very
         * large sending queues.
         * See section 'XMail spool design' for a description of how the spool
         * works.
         * Due to the new spool format the following directories can be
         * removed:
         *
         * custdomains/spool
         * spool/tmp
         * spool/errors
         * spool/logs
         * spool/locks
         *
         * You've to leave XMail flush its queue (spool) before upgrading
         * to this version.
         * A more complex solution, if You've a lot of file pending into the
         * spool, is :
         *
         * 1) Stop XMail
         * 2) Upgrade to 0.61
         * 3) Start XMail and wait it has created all the queue tree structure
         * 4) Stop XMail
         * 5) Move all old spool/ files into 0/0/mess
         * 6) Rename all spool/logs/ files removing the .log extension
         * 7) Move all spool/logs/ file into 0/0/slog
         * 8) Now You can remove the above directories and restart XMail
         ********************************************************************

    *   ORBS relays checking has been added and is activated by the new
        SERVER.TAB option 'ORBS-MAPSCheck'.

    *   A new SERVER.TAB variable 'AllowNullSender' (default true) has been
        introduced to change the XMail default behaviour that reject null
        sender messages. Now if You want null sender messages to be rejected
        You've to set this variable to zero.

    *   Fixed a bug in Linux XMail debug startup.

    *   Now SMTP authentication does a previous lookup in mailusers.tab
        using the complete email address as username (@ or : as separators).

    *   Authenticated users will get the permission stored in the new
        'DefaultSmtpPerms' SERVER.TAB variable.

        version of XMail or edit SvrConfig.h defining CONFIG_MAILDIR for
        both Linux and NT version).

    *   If You want to switch to the new Maildir version You MUST convert
        Your accounts and You MUST create a tmp directory inside
        $MAIL_ROOT/spool.

    *   The maximum number of recipients for a single SMTP message has been
        made tunable by a new command line parameter (-Sr ... , default
        100).

        recipients.

    *   New POP3 username/domain separator (:) has been introduced other
        than (@) that is not a valid char for Netscape mail system.

    *   A buffer overflow bug has been corrected (the bug outcrop when a
        line is longer than the supplied buffer and a newline char is
        exactly placed at the buffer[sizeof(buffer)-1]).

    *   Mail loop check has been introduced.

    *   Fixed a bug that makes XMail unable to correctly handle SMTP lines
        terminated by <CR><CR><LF>.

  July 13, 2000 v 0.57

    *   Fixed a SERIOUS bug introduced with the new indexing features of
        XMail that makes names case sensitive. You must also empty the
        tabindex directory to enable XMail to rebuild indexes in a case
        insensitive way. Update SOON to this version.

    *   The maximum number of accounts has been removed due the new locking
        method.

    *   Now the -Ma ... parameter give XMail a way to allocate locking
        resources, but it's not as strict as it was with previous versions.

    *   New CTRL commands has been added (cfgfileget, cfgfileset).

    *   A new command line utility to create user accounts based on a

    *   Now the files mailusers.tab , aliases.tab and extaliases.tab are
        indexed for a faster lookup in case of having several thousands of
        users and / or aliases. For this need a new directory named tabindex
        __MUST__ be added to MAIL_ROOT path.

    *   As a consequence of this new feature You __CANNOT__ edit files under
        index while XMail is running.

    *   POP3 mailbox locking method is changed to speedup startup time in
