#   SMTPAUTH.TAB
#
#     "username"[TAB]"password"[TAB]"permissions"[NEWLINE]
#
#    is used to permit SMTP clients authentication with protocols PLAIN,
#    LOGIN, CRAM-MD5 and custom. With custom authentication a file containing
#    all secrets (username + ':' + password) is passed as parameter to the
#    custom authentication program which tests all secrets to find the one
#    matching (if exist). For this reason it's better to keep the number of
#    entries in this file as low as possible. Permissions are a string that
#    can contain:
#
#    M   open mailing features
#
#    R   open relay features (bypass all other relay blocking traps)
#
#    V   VRFY command enabled (bypass SERVER.TAB variable)
#
#    T   ETRN command enabled (bypass SERVER.TAB variable)
#
#    Z   disable mail size checking (bypass SERVER.TAB variable)
#
#    S   ease SSL requirement for this user (bypass the "WantTLS" mail config
#        variable)
#
#    When PLAIN, LOGIN or CRAM-MD5 authentication mode are used, first a
#    lookup in 'MAILUSERS.TAB' accounts is performed to avoid duplicating
#    information with 'SMTPAUTH.TAB'. Therefore when using these
#    authentication modes a user must use as username the full email address
#    (the : separator is permitted instead of @) and as password his POP3
#    password. If the lookup succeed the 'SERVER.TAB' variable
#    'DefaultSmtpPerms' is used to assign user SMTP permissions (default MR).
#    If the lookup fails then 'SMTPAUTH.TAB' lookup is done.
