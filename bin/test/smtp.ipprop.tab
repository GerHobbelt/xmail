#   SMTP.IPPROP.TAB
#
#    This file lists SMTP properties to be associated with the remote SMTP
#    peer IP. The format of the file is:
#
#     "ip-addr"[TAB]"var0=value0"...[TAB]"varN=valueN"[NEWLINE]
#
#    Example:
#
#     "192.168.0.7/32"   "WhiteList=1"
#
#    Address selection mask are formed by an IP address (network) plus the
#    number of valid bits inside the network mask. No space are allowed
#    between the variable name and the '=' sign and between the '=' sign and
#    the value. These are the currently defined variables:
#
#    WhiteList
#        If set to 1, all peer IP based checks will be skipped.
#
#    EaseTLS
#        If set to 1, drops the TLS requirement for SMTP sessions coming from
#        the matched network.
#
#    SenderDomainCheck
#        If set to 0, bypasses the "CheckMailerDomain" 'SERVER.TAB' variable.
