#
#    This file contains server configuration variables. See "SERVER.TAB
#    variables" below for details.
#
#
#
#SERVER.TAB VARIABLES
#
#    The following variables are for use int the "SERVER.TAB" configuration
#    file.
#
#    [RootDomain]
#        Indicate the primary domain for the server.
#
#    [SmtpServerDomain]
#        If set, forces the domain name XMail uses inside the ESMTP greeting
#        used to support CRAM-MD5 ESMTP authentication.
#
#    [POP3Domain]
#        Set the default domain for POP3 client connections.
#
#    [PostMaster]
#        Set the postmaster address.
#
#    [ErrorsAdmin]
#        The email address that receives notification messages for every
#        message that has had delivery errors. If it is empty (allowed), the
#        notification message is sent to the sender only.
#
#    [TempErrorsAdmin]
#        The email address that receives notification for temporary delivery
#        failures. In case it's empty the notification message is sent to the
#        sender only.
#
#    [DefaultSMTPGateways]
#        A semicolon separated list of SMTP servers XMail 'must' use to send
#        its mails. The definition can also contain options as a
#        comma-separated list (see [SMTP GATEWAY CONFIGURATION] for more
#        information). Example:
#
#          "192.168.0.1,NeedTLS=2;192.168.0.2"
#
#        This has the precedence over MX records.
#
#    [HeloDomain]
#        If this variable is specified and is not empty, its content is sent
#        as HELO domain. Otherwise the reverse lookup of the local IP is sent
#        as HELO domain. This helps to deal with remote SMTP servers that are
#        set to check the reverse lookup of the incoming IP.
#
#    [CheckMailerDomain]
#        Enable validation of the sender domain ('MAIL FROM:<...@xxx>') by
#        looking up DNS/MX entries.
#
#    [RemoveSpoolErrors]
#        Indicate if mail has to be removed or stored in 'froz' directory
#        after a failure in delivery or filtering.
#
#    [NotifyMsgLinesExtra]
#        Number of lines of the bounced message that have to be listed inside
#        the notify message (lines after the headers section). Default is
#        zero.
#
#    [NotifySendLogToSender]
#        Enable/Disable sending the message log file inside the notify
#        message to the sender. Default is off (zero).
#
#    [NotifyTryPattern]
#        List of delivery attempts that require the system to send a
#        notification to the sender (and eventually to 'TempErrorsAdmin').
#        The list is a comma separated list of numbers (with no extra spaces)
#        as in:
#
#         "1,4,9"
#
#        Default is empty which means no notification is sent upon a delivery
#        attempt failure.
#
#    [AllowNullSender]
#        Enable null sender ('MAIL FROM:<>') messages to be accepted by
#        XMail.
#
#    [NoSenderBounce]
#        When building bounce messages, use the null SMTP sender ('MAIL
#        FROM:<>') instead of the 'PostMaster' address. This will affect only
#        the SMTP sender, while the message RFC822 headers will still contain
#        the correct From: header.
#
#    [MaxMTAOps]
#        Set the maximum number of MTA relay steps before to declare the
#        message as looped (default 16).
#
#    [ReceivedHdrType]
#        Set the verbosity of the Received: message headers tag.
#
#        '0'     Standard (client IP shown , server IP not). Default.
#
#        '1'     Verbose (client IP shown , server IP shown)
#
#        '2'     Strict (no IP shown)
#
#        '3'     Same as 0 but the client IP is not shown if the client
#                authenticate itself.
#
#        '4'     Same as 1 but the client IP is not shown if the client
#                authenticate itself.
#
#    [FetchHdrTags]
#        Set the list of headers tags to be used to extract addresses from
#        POP3 fetched messages ("POP3LINKS.TAB"). This is a comma delimited
#        list (no extra space or TABs must be included inside the list) as
#        in:
#
#         "+X-Deliver-To,To,Cc"
#
#        Tags preceded by a '+' character make XMail stop scanning when an
#        address is found inside the header tag.
#
#        Tags preceded by a '+' character must be listed before other tags.
#
#        The string "+X-Deliver-To,To,Cc" is the default if nothing is
#        specified.
#
#    [SMTP-MaxErrors]
#        Set the maximum number of errors allowed in a single SMTP session.
#        When the maximum number of allowed errors is exceeded, the
#        connection will be automatically dropped. If such variable is not
#        set, or it is set to zero, the maximum number of errors will be
#        unlimited.
#
#    [SmtpMsgIPBanSpammers]
#        Used to set the message that is sent to the SMTP client when the
#        client IP is listed inside the file SPAMMER.TAB.
#
#    [SmtpMsgIPBanSpamAddress]
#        Used to set the message that is sent to the SMTP client when the
#        client IP is listed inside the file SPAM-ADDRESS.TAB.
#
#    [SmtpMsgIPBanMaps]
#        Used to set the message that is sent to the SMTP client when the
#        client IP is listed inside one of the "CustMapsList".
#
#    [SmtpMsgIPBan]
#        Used to set the message that is sent to the SMTP client when the
#        client IP is listed inside the file SMTP.IPMAP.TAB.
#
#    [CustomSMTPMessage]
#        Set this to the message that you want to follow the standard SMTP
#        error response sent by XMail, as in (one line, remember the =>):
#
#         "Please open http://www.xmailserver.test/smtp_errors.html to get=>
#            more information about this error"
#
#        Please be aware the RFC821 fix the maximum reply line length to 512
#        bytes.
#
#    [SMTP-IpMapDropCode]
#        Set the drop code for IPs blocked by the SMTP.IPMAP.TAB file:
#
#        '1'     the connection is dropped soon
#
#        "0"     the connection is kept alive but only authenticated users
#                can send mail
#
#        '-S'    the peer can send messages but a delay of S seconds is
#                introduced between commands
#
#    [AllowSmtpVRFY]
#        Enable the use of VRFY SMTP command. This flag may be forced by SMTP
#        authentication.
#
#    [AllowSmtpETRN]
#        Enable the use of ETRN SMTP command. This flag may be forced by SMTP
#        authentication.
#
#    [SmtpMinDiskSpace]
#        Minimum disk space (in Kb) that is requested before accepting an
#        SMTP connection.
#
#    [SmtpMinVirtMemSpace]
#        Minimum virtual memory (in Kb) that is requested before accepting an
#        SMTP connection.
#
#    [Pop3MinVirtMemSpace]
#        Minimum virtual memory (in Kb) that is requested before accepting a
#        POP3 connection.
#
#    [Pop3SyncErrorAccount]
#        This defines the email account (MUST be handled locally) that
#        receives all fetched email that XMail has not been able to deliver.
#
#    [EnableAuthSMTP-POP3]
#        Enable SMTP after POP3 authentication (default on).
#
#    [MaxMessageSize]
#        Set the maximum message size in Kb that is possible to send through
#        the server.
#
#    [DefaultSmtpPerms]
#        This list SMTP permissions assigned to users looked up inside
#        "MAILUSERS.TAB" during SMTP authentication. It also defines the
#        permissions for users authenticated with SMTP after POP3.
#
#    [CustMapsList]
#        This is a list a user can use to set custom maps checking. The list
#        has the given (strict) format:
#
#        maps-root:code,maps-root:code...
#
#        Where maps-root is the root for the dns query (ie.
#        dialups.mail-abuse.org.) and the code can be:
#
#        '1'     the connection is dropped soon
#
#        "0"     the connection is kept alive but only authenticated users
#                can send mail
#
#        '-S'    the peer can send messages but a delay of S seconds is
#                introduced between commands
#
#    [SMTP-RDNSCheck]
#        Indicate if XMail must do an RDNS lookup before accepting a incoming
#        SMTP connection. If 0, the check is not performed; if 1 and the
#        check fails, the user receives a 'server use forbidden' at MAIL_FROM
#        time; if -S (S > 0) and the check fails, a delay of S seconds
#        between SMTP commands is used to prevent massive spamming.
#
#        SMTP authentication overrides the denial set by this option by
#        giving authenticated users the ability to access the server from
#        'mapped' IPs.
#
#    [SmartDNSHost]
#        Setup a list of smart DNS hosts to which are directed DNS queries
#        with recursion bit set to true. Such DNS hosts must support DNS
#        recursion in queries. The format is:
#
#         dns.home.bogus.net:tcp,192.168.1.1:udp,...
#
#    [DisableEmitAuthUser]
#        Enable/disable the emission the the 'X-AuthUser:' mail header for
#        authenticated users. Valid values are "0" or '1', default is "0"
#        (emission enabled).
#
#    [SmtpGwConfig]
#        Sets global SMTP gateway options. Those can be overridden by
#        specific gateway options. See [SMTP GATEWAY CONFIGURATION] for
#        information.
#
#    [Pop3LogPasswd]
#        Control if POP3 passwords are logged into the POP3 log file. Set to
#        "0" to disable password logging, set to "1" to enable logging of
#        failed logins, and the to "2" to always enable password logging.
#        Default is "0".
#
#    [SmtpNoTLSAuths]
#        Lists a comma-separated sequence of SMTP authentications that are
#        allowed while the connections is in non-TLS mode (clear text). Do
#        not set this variable if you do not want to impose any restriction,
#        or set it to the empty string if you do not want any authentication
#        method to be allowed in clear-text mode.
#
#    [EnableCTRL-TLS]
#        Enable CTRL TLS negotiation (default "1").
#
#    [EnablePOP3-TLS]
#        Enable POP3 TLS (STLS) negotiation (default "1").
#
#    [EnableSMTP-TLS]
#        Enable SMTP TLS (STARTTLS) negotiation (default "1").
#
#    [SSLUseCertsFile]
#    [SSLUseCertsDir]
#    [SSLWantVerify]
#    [SSLAllowSelfSigned]
#    [SSLWantCert]
#    [SSLMaxCertsDepth]
#        See [SSL CONFIGURATION] for information.
#
#    [SmtpConfig]
#        Default SMTP server config loaded if specific server IP[,PORT]
#        config is not found.
#
#    [SmtpConfig-IP | SmtpConfig-IP,PORT]
#        Specific IP or IP,PORT SMTP server config. Examples:
#
#         "SmtpConfig-192.168.1.123" "..."
#         "SmtpConfig-192.168.1.17,1025" "..."
#
#        The variable value is a comma separated sequence of configuration
#        tokens whose meaning is:
#
#        MailAuth
#                authentication required to send mail to the server. Please
#                note that by setting this value everything requires
#                authentication, even for sending to local domains, and this
#                is probably not what you want. The "mail-auth" is also
#                synonym of "MailAuth".
#
#        WantTLS TLS connection needed to talk to this server. This is either
#                done by issuing a STARTTLS command over a standard SMTP
#                session, or by using an SMTPS port
