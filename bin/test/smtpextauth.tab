#   SMTPEXTAUTH.TAB
#
#    The 'SMTPEXTAUTH.TAB' file enable the XMail administrator to use
#    external authentications methods to verify SMTP clients. If the
#    'SMTPEXTAUTH.TAB' does not exist, or it is empty, XMail standard
#    authentication methods are used, and those will use either the
#    'MAILUSERS.TAB' or the 'SMTPAUTH.TAB' to verify account credentials. If
#    the file 'SMTPEXTAUTH.TAB' is not empty, then the XMail standard
#    authentication methods are not advertised in the AUTH response of the
#    EHLO SMTP command. Instead, only the ones listed inside the
#    'SMTPEXTAUTH.TAB' are reported to the SMTP client. The 'SMTPEXTAUTH.TAB'
#    file can contain multiple lines with the following format:
#
#     "auth-name"[TAB]"program-path"[TAB]"arg-or-macro"...[NEWLINE]
#
#    This file can contain multiple lines whose 'auth-name' are listed during
#    the EHLO command response. Where 'arg-or-macro' can be (see [MACRO
#    SUBSTITUTION]):
#
#    AUTH
#        authentication method (PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, ...)
#
#    USER
#        SMTP client supplied username (available in PLAIN, LOGIN and
#        CRAM-MD5)
#
#    PASS
#        SMTP client supplied password (available in PLAIN and LOGIN)
#
#    CHALL
#        challenge used by the server (available in CRAM-MD5)
#
#    DGEST
#        client response to server challenge (@CHALL - available in CRAM-MD5)
#
#    RFILE
#        a file path where the external authentication binary might supply
#        extra informations/credentials about the account (available in all
#        authentications)
#
#    The RFILE file is composed by multiple lines with the following format:
#
#      VAR=VALUE
#
#    Currently supported variables inside the RFILE file are:
#
#    Perms
#        Supply SMTP permissions for the account (see [SMTPAUTH.TAB] for
#        detailed inforamtion)
#
#    Example:
#
#     "PLAIN" "/usr/bin/my-auth" "-a" "@@AUTH" "-u" "@@USER" "-p" "@@PASS" "-r" "@@RFILE"
#
#    The external authentication binary may or may not fill a response file.
#    If the authentication has been successful, the binary should exit with a
#    code equal to zero. Any other exit code different from zero, will be
#    interpreted as failure.
