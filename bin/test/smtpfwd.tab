#     "domain"[TAB]"smtp-mx-list"[NEWLINE]
#
#    The "smtp-mx-list" is a semicolon separated list of SMTP relays, and can
#    also contain options as a comma-separated list (see [SMTP GATEWAY
#    CONFIGURATION] for more information).
#
#    Examples:
#
#     "foo.example.com"   "mail.xmailserver.org:7001;192.168.1.1:6123,NeedTLS=1;mx.xmailserver.org"
#
#    sends all mail for 'foo.example.com' using the provided list of mail
#    exchangers, while:
#
#     "*.dummy.net"   "mail.xmailserver.org,NeedTLS=1;192.168.1.1;mx.xmailserver.org:6423"
#
#    sends all mail for "*'*.dummy.net' through the provided list of mail
#    exchangers. If the port (:nn) is not specified the default SMTP port
#    (25) is assumed. you can also enable XMail to random-select the order of
#    the gateway list by specifying:
#
#     "*.dummy.net"   "#mail.xmailserver.org;192.168.1.1;mx.xmailserver.org:6423"
#
#    using the character '#' as the first char of the gateway list.
