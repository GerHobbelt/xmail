#    contains user default values for new users that are not set during the
#    new account creation. This file is looked up in two different places,
#    first in '$MAIL_ROOT/domains/DOMAIN' then in '$MAIL_ROOT', where
#    'DOMAIN' is the name of the domain where We're going to create the new
#    user.
#
#    For each 'domain' handled by the server we'll create a directory
#    'domain' inside $MAIL_ROOT. Inside $MAIL_ROOT/'domain' reside
#    'domain'->'account' directories ($MAIL_ROOT/'domain'/'account'). This
#    folder contains a sub folder named 'mailbox' (or
#    'Maildir/(tmp,new,cur)') that stores all 'account' messages. It also
#    contains a file named 'USER.TAB' that stores"account" variables,
#    example:
#
#     "RealName"  "Davide Libenzi"
#     "HomePage"  "http://www.xmailserver.org/davide.html"
#     "MaxMBSize" "30000"
