#
#    This file controls the global IP access permission to the POP3 server if
#    located in the MAIL_ROOT path, and user IP access to its POP3 mailbox if
#    located inside the user directory.
#
#    Example:
#
#     "0.0.0.0"  "0.0.0.0"  "DENY"  "1"
#     "212.131.173.0"  "255.255.255.0"  "ALLOW"  "2"
#
#    This configuration denies access to all IPs except the ones of the class
#    'C' network '212.131.173.XXX'.
#
#    Higher precedences win over lower ones.
#



"0.0.0.0"	"0.0.0.0"	"ALLOW"	1
