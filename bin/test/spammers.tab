#

#
#    Example:
#
#     "212.131.173.0"  "255.255.255.0"
#     "212.131.173.0/24"
#
#    register all hosts of the class 'C' network '212.131.173.XXX' as
#    spammers, and block them the use of XMail SMTP server. If a match is
#    found on one of those records, XMail will reject the incoming SMTP
#    connection at early stages. It is possible to specify optional
#    parameters to tell XMail which behaviour it should assume in case of
#    match. An example of such setup is:
#
#     "212.131.173.0/24"  "code=0"
#
#    In this case a code=0 tells XMail to flag the connection as possible
#    spammer, but wait later SMTP session stages to reject the connection
#    itself. In this case an authenticated SMTP session can override the
#    SPAMMERS.TAB match. The optional "params" field lists parameters
#    associated with the record, separated by a comma:
#
#     "param1=value1,param2=value2,...,paramN=valueN"
#
#    Currently supported parameters are:
#
#    code
#        Specify the rejection code for the record. If the value is greater
#        than zero, the connection is rejected soon, and the remote SMTP
#        client is disconnected. If the value is zero, the connection is
#        flagged as spammer but wait later stages for rejection, by allowing
#        authenticated SMTP connections to bypass the SPAMMERS.TAB match. If
#        the value is less than zero, XMail will insert an "absolute value"
#        seconds delay between SMTP commands. Default value for code is
#        greater than zero (immediate rejection).
