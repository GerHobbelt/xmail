#
#    (remember, enter as one line) where:
#
#    'authtype' = Comma-separated list of options:
#
#    CLR Use clear-text USER/PASS authentication
#
#    APOP
#        Use POP3 APOP authentication (that does not send clear-text
#        passwords over the wire). Fall back to 'CLR' if 'APOP' is not
#        supported
#
#    FAPOP
#        Use POP3 APOP authentication (that does not send clear-text
#        passwords over the wire).
#
#    STLS
#        Establish an SSL link with the server by issuing a POP3 STLS
#        command. Continue with the non-encrypted link is STLS is not
#        supported
#
#    FSTLS
#        Establish an SSL link with the server by issuing a POP3 STLS
#        command.
#
#    POP3S
#        Establish a full POP3S connection with the remote server.
#
#    Leave
#        Leave messages on the server, and download only the new ones. In
#        order this functionality to work, the remote POP3 server must
#        support the UIDL command.
#
#    OutBind
#        Sets the IP address of the network interface that should be used
#        when connecting to the remote host. This configuration should be
#        used carefully, because XMail will fail if the selected IP of the
#        interface does not have a route to the remote host using such IP.
#
#    Examples;
#
#     "home.bogus"    "dlibenzi"  "xmailserver.org"   "dlibenzi" "XYZ..."=>
#       "APOP"
#
#    This entry is used to synchronize the external account
#    'dlibenzi@xmailserver.org' with encrypted password 'XYZ...' with the
#    local account 'dlibenzi@home.bogus' using 'APOP' authentication. It
#    connect with the 'xmailserver.org' POP3 server and download all messages
#    for 'dlibenzi@xmailserver.org' into the local account
#    'dlibenzi@home.bogus'. The remote server must support 'APOP'
#    authentication to specify 'APOP' as authtype. Even if using APOP
#    authentication is more secure because clear usernames and password does
#    not travel on the network, if you're not sure about it, specify 'CLR' as
#    authtype. For non local POP3 sync you've to specify a line like this one
#    (@ as the first domain char):
#
#     "@home.bogus.com"   "dlibenzi"  "xmailserver.org:110"   "dlibenzi" "XYZ..."=>
#       "CLR"
#
#    This entry is used to synchronize the external account
#    'dlibenzi@xmailserver.org' with encrypted password 'XYZ...' with the
#    account 'dlibenzi@home.bogus.com' using 'CLR' authentication. The
#    message is pushed into the spool having as destination
#    dlibenzi@home.bogus.com , so you've to have some kind of processing for
#    that user or domain in your XMail configuration (for example custom
#    domain processing). you can also have the option to setup a line like
#    this one:
#
#     "?home.bogus.com,felins.net,pets.org"   "dlibenzi"  "xmailserver.org"=>
#       "dlibenzi"  "XYZ..."    "CLR"
#
#    and messages are dropped inside the spool by following these rules:
#
#    1.  XMail parse the message headers by searching for To:, Cc: and Bcc:
#        addresses.
#
#    2.  Each address's domain is compared with the list of valid domains
#        (felins.net, pets.org).
#
#    3.  For each valid address the username part is taken and joined with
#        the '@' and the masquerade domain name (the name following '?').
#
#    4.  The message is spooled with the above built destination address.
#
#    Obviously the masquerade domain ('home.bogus.com') MUST be handled by
#    the server or MUST be a valid external mail domain. So if a message
#    having as To: address graycat@felins.net is fetched by the previous line
#    a message is pushed into the spool with address graycat@home.bogus.com.
#    Particular attention is to be taken about at not creating mail loops.
#    Another option is:
#
#     "&.local,felins.net,pets.org"   "dlibenzi"  "xmailserver.org" "dlibenzi"=>
#       "XYZ..."    "CLR"
#
#    where a fetched message whose To: address is graycat@felins.net is
#    replaced with graycat@felins.net.local. You can avoid the matching
#    domain list after the masquerading domain but, in that case, you may
#    have bad destination addresses inside the spool. The list MUST be comma
#    separated WITHOUT spaces. XMail starts PSYNC session with a delay that
#    you can specify with the -Yi nsec command line parameter (default 120).
#    XMail also checks for the presence (inside MAIL_ROOT) of a file named
#    '.psync-trigger' and, when this file is found, a PSYNC session starts
#    and that file is removed.
