#MESSAGE FILTERS
#
#    This feature offers a way to filter messages by providing the ability to
#    execute external programs, such as scripts or real executables. These
#    'filters' may examine and/or modify messages and inform XMail of their
#    actions with a return value.
#
#    This feature offers the ability to inspect and modify messages, giving a
#    way to reject messages based on content, alter messages (address
#    rewriting) and so on.
#
#    If this filters returns '4, 5 or 6' the message is rejected and is
#    stopped in its travel. If the filter modifies the message it must return
#    '7'.
#
#    Additional flags are allowed to be returned to XMail as a result of
#    filter processing by adding the flags value to the exits code above
#    listed. The currently defined flags are :
#
#    '16'
#        Stop selected filter list processing.
#
#    Filter flags are additive and if more than one flag need to be
#    specified, their values must be added together. If a filter "raw" exit
#    code is RC and the filter needs to return extra flags FILTER-SUM, the
#    final return code FRC must be :
#
#    FRC = RC + FILTER-SUM
#
#    Example. Suppose a filter modified the message and hence needs to return
#    7 as return code. Suppose also that a filter wants to block the filter
#    selection list processing by specifying a flags value of 16, the value
#    to be returned will be :
#
#    FRC = 7 + 16 = 23
#
#    Filter selection is driven by two files 'FILTERS.IN.TAB' and
#    'FILTERS.OUT.TAB' located inside the $MAIL_ROOT/ directory and that have
#    the following format:
#
#     "sender"[TAB]"recipient"[TAB]"remote-addr"[TAB]"local-addr"[TAB]"filename"[NEWLINE]
#
#    For example:
#
#     "*@bad-domain.com" "*" "0.0.0.0/0" "0.0.0.0/0" "av-filter.tab"
#     "*" "clean@purified.net" "0.0.0.0/0" "0.0.0.0/0" "spam-block.tab"
#     "*" "*" "192.168.1.0/24" "0.0.0.0/0" "archive.tab"
#
#    where the file "av-filter.tab" must be present inside the
#    $MAIL_ROOT/filters directory. The "sender" and the "recipient" are
#    resolved to the real account when possible. Address selection mask are
#    formed by an IP address (network) plus the number of valid bits inside
#    the network mask. The file 'FILTERS.IN.TAB' lists filters that have to
#    be applied to inbound messages (going to local mailboxes) while the file
#    'FILTERS.OUT.TAB' lists filters that have to be applied to outbound
#    messages (delivered remotely). All four
#    (sender+recipient+remote-addr+local-addr) selection fields must have a
#    match in order "filename" to be evaluated. The syntax of the filter file
#    is:
#
#     "command"[TAB]"arg-or-macro"[TAB]...[NEWLINE]
#
#    or:
#
#     "!flags"[TAB]"command"[TAB]"arg-or-macro"[TAB]...[NEWLINE]
#
#    Each file may contain multiple commands, that will be executed in
#    strictly sequential order. The first command that will trigger a
#    rejection code will make the filtering process to end. The 'flags'
#    parameter is a comma-separated list of flags that drives the filter
#    execution. The syntax of each flag is either FLAG or FLAG=VAL. Currently
#    supported flags are:
#
#    aex exclude filter execution in case of authenticated sender
#
#    wlex
#        exclude filter execution in case the client IP is white-listed
#        inside the SMTP.IPPROP.TAB file. This flag works only for SMTP
#        filters.
#
#    Each argument can be a macro also (see [MACRO SUBSTITUTION]):
#
#    FROM
#        the sender of the message
#
#    RFROM
#        the sender of the message resolved to the real account, when
#        possible (alias resolution)
#
#    RCPT
#        the target of the message
#
#    RRCPT
#        the target of the message resolved to the real account, when
#        possible (alias resolution)
#
#    REMOTEADDR
#        remote IP address and port of the sender
#
#    LOCALADDR
#        local IP address and port where the message has been accepted
#
#    FILE
#        the message file path (the external command may modify the file if
#        it returns '7' as command exit value.)
#
#    MSGID
#        with the (XMail unique) message id
#
#    MSGREF
#        the reference SMTP message id
#
#    USERAUTH
#        name of the SMTP authenticated user, or "-" if no authentication has
#        been supplied
#
#    Here 'command' is the name of an external program that processes the
#    message and returns its processing result. If it returns '6' the message
#    is rejected and a notification message is sent to the sender. By
#    returning '5' the message is rejected without notification. While
#    returning '4' the message is rejected without notification and without
#    being frozen (a '5' response could lead to a frozen message if the
#    "SERVER.TAB" configuration enables this). If all filters return values
#    different from '6, 5 and 4' the message continues its trip. The filter
#    command may also modify the file (AV scanning, content filter, message
#    rewriting, etc) by returning '7'. The filter 'MUST' return '7' in case
#    it modifies the message. If the filter changes the message file it
#    'MUST' keep the message structure and it 'MUST' terminate all line with
#    <CR><LF>. The filter has also the ability to return a one-line custom
#    return message by creating a file named $(FILE).rej holding the message
#    in the very first line. This file should be created 'ONLY' when the
#    filter returns a rejection code ('6, 5 and 4')and 'NEVER' in case of
#    passthru code ('7') or modify code.
#
#    The spool files has this structure:
#
#     Info Data           [ 1th line ]
#     SmtpDomain          [ 2nd line ]
#     SmtpMessageID       [ 3rd line ]
#     MAIL FROM:<...>     [ 4th line ]
#     RCPT TO:<...>       [ 5th line ]
#     <<MAIL-DATA>>       [ 6th line ]
#     ...
#
#    After the '<<MAIL-DATA>>' tag (5th line) the message follows. The
#    message is composed of a headers section and, after the first empty
#    line, the message body. The format of the "Info Data" line is:
#
#     [ClientIP]:ClientPort;[ServerIP]:ServerPort;Time
#
#    'EXTREME' care must be used when modifying the message because the
#    filter will be working on the real message, and a badly reformatted file
#    will lead to message loss. The spool file header (any data before
#    <<MAIL-DATA>>) 'MUST' be preserved as is by the filter in case of
#    message rewrite happens.
