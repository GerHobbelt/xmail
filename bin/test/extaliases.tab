#    Example:
#
#     "xmailserver.org"   "dlibenzi"  "home.bogus"    "dlibenzi"
#
#    This file is used in configurations in which the server does not run
#    directly on Internet (like my case) but acts as internal mail exchanger
#    and external mail gateway. This file defines 'Return-Path: <...>'
#    mapping for internal mail delivery. If you are using a Mail client like
#    Outlook, Eudora, KMail ... you have to configure your email address with
#    the external account say 'dlibenzi@xmailserver.org'. When you post an
#    internal message to 'foo@home.bogus' the mail client puts your external
#    email address ('dlibenzi@xmailserver.org') in the 'MAIL FROM: <...>'
#    SMTP request. Now if the user 'foo' replies to this message, it replies
#    to 'dlibenzi@xmailserver.org', and then is sent to the external mail
#    server. With the entry above in 'EXTALIASES.TAB' file the 'Return-Path:
#    <...>' field is filled with 'dlibenzi@home.bogus' that leads to an
#    internal mail reply.
#
#    You 'CANNOT' edit this file while XMail is running because it is an
#    indexed file.
