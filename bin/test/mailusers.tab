#    (remember, enter as one line.) Example:
#
#     "home.bogus"    "dlibenzi"  "XYZ..."    1   "dlibenzi"  "U"
#
#    defines an account 'dlibenzi' in domain 'home.bogus' with the encrypted
#    password 'XYZ...', user id '1' and mail directory 'dlibenzi' inside
#    '$MAIL_ROOT/domains/home.bogus'. To allow multiple domain handling the
#    POP3 client must use the entire email address for the POP3 user account;
#    for example. if a user has email user@domain it must supply:
#
#     user@domain
#
#    as POP3 account login.
#
#    The directory 'account-dir' 'must' case match with the field
#    'account-dir' of this file. Note that user id 'must' be unique for all
#    users (duplicate user ids are not allowed). The user id 0 is reserved by
#    XMail and cannot be used.
#
#    The last field 'U' is the account type:
#
#     "U" = User account
#     "M" = Mailing list account
#
#    The encrypted password is generated by 'XMCrypt' whose source is
#    'XMCrypt.cpp'. Even if external authentication is used (see "External
#    Authentication") this file 'must' contain an entry for each user handled
#    by XMail.
#
#    You 'CANNOT' edit this file while XMail is running because it is an
#    indexed file.
