#SMTP MESSAGE FILTERS
#
#    Besides having the ability to perform off-line message filtering, XMail
#    gives the user the power to run filters during the SMTP session. Three
#    files drive the SMTP on-line filtering, and these are
#    'FILTERS.POST-RCPT.TAB', 'FILTERS.PRE-DATA.TAB' and
#    'FILTERS.POST-DATA.TAB'. The file 'FILTERS.POST-RCPT.TAB', contains one
#    or more commands to be executed after the remote SMTP client sends the
#    RCPT_TO command(s), and before XMail sends the response to the command.
#    The file 'FILTERS.PRE-DATA.TAB' contains one or more commands to be
#    executed after the remote SMTP client sends the DATA command, and before
#    XMail sends the response to the command. Using such filters, the user
#    can tell XMail if or if not accept the following transaction and, in
#    case of rejection, the user is also allowed to specify a custom message
#    to be sent to the remote SMTP client. The file 'FILTERS.POST-DATA.TAB'
#    contains one or more commands to be executed after XMail received the
#    whole client DATA, and before XMail sends the final response to the DATA
#    command (final messages ack). The files 'FILTERS.POST-RCPT.TAB',
#    'FILTERS.PRE-DATA.TAB' and 'FILTERS.POST-DATA.TAB' contains zero or more
#    lines with the following format:
#
#     "command"[TAB]"arg-or-macro"[TAB]...[NEWLINE]
#
#    or:
#
#     "!flags"[TAB]"command"[TAB]"arg-or-macro"[TAB]...[NEWLINE]
#
#    Each file may contain multiple commands, that will be executed in
#    strictly sequential order. The first command that will trigger a
#    rejection code will make the filtering process to end. The 'flags'
#    parameter is a comma-separated list of flags that drives the filter
#    execution. The syntax of each flag is either FLAG or FLAG=VAL. Currently
#    supported flags are:
#
#    aex exclude filter execution in case of authenticated sender
#
#    wlex
#        exclude filter execution in case the client IP is white-listed
#        inside the SMTP.IPPROP.TAB file.
#
#    Each argument can be a macro also (see [MACRO SUBSTITUTION]):
#
#    FILE
#        message file path
#
#    USERAUTH
#        name of the SMTP authenticated user, or "-" if no authentication has
#        been supplied
#
#    REMOTEADDR
#        remote IP address and port of the sender
#
#    LOCALADDR
#        local IP address and port where the message has been accepted
#
#    FROM
#        message sender address
#
#    CRCPT
#        last recipient submitted by the client. For post-rcpt filters, this
#        will be used as to-validate recipient
#
#    RRCPT
#        last recipient submitted by the client, translated to the real
#        account (in case of aliases)
#
#    Filter commands have the ability to inspect and modify the content of
#    the message (or info) file. The exit code of commands executed by XMail
#    are used to tell XMail the action that has to be performed as a
#    consequence of the filter. The exit code is composed by a raw exit code
#    and additional flags. Currently defined flags are:
#
#    '16'
#        Stop selected filter list processing.
#
#    Currently defined raw exit codes are:
#
#    '3' Reject the message.
#
#    Any other exit codes will make XMail to accept the message, and can be
#    used also when changing the content of the $(FILE) file. 'EXTREME' care
#    must be used when changing the $(FILE) file, since XMail expect the file
#    format to be correct. Also, it is important to preserve the <CR><LF>
#    line termination of the file itself. When rejecting the message, the
#    filter command has the ability to specify the SMTP status code that
#    XMail will send to the remote SMTP client, by creating a file named
#    $(FILE).rej containing the message in the very first line. Such file
#    will be automatically removed by XMail. The data passed to filter
#    commands inside $(FILE) varies depending if the command is listed inside
#    'FILTERS.POST-RCPT.TAB', 'FILTERS.PRE-DATA.TAB' or inside
#    'FILTERS.POST-DATA.TAB'. Commands listed inside 'FILTERS.POST-RCPT.TAB'
#    and 'FILTERS.PRE-DATA.TAB' will receive the following data stored inside
#    $(FILE):
#
#     Info Data           [ 1th line ]
#     SmtpDomain          [ 2nd line ]
#     SmtpMessageID       [ 3rd line ]
#     MAIL FROM:<...>     [ 4th line ]
#     RCPT TO:<...> {...} [ 5th line ]
#     ...
#
#    The file can have one or more "RCPT TO" lines. The format of the "Info
#    Data" line is:
#
#     ClientDomain;[ClientIP]:ClientPort;ServerDomain;[ServerIP]:ServerPort;Time;Logo
#
#    Note that in case of 'FILTERS.POST-RCPT.TAB', the $(FILE) data does not
#    yet contain the current recipient to be validated. This needs to be
#    fetched and passed to the external program using the $(CRCPT) macro (or
#    $(RRCPT)). Commands listed inside 'FILTERS.POST-DATA.TAB' will receive
#    the following data stored inside $(FILE):
#
#     Info Data           [ 1th line ]
#     SmtpDomain          [ 2nd line ]
#     SmtpMessageID       [ 3rd line ]
#     MAIL FROM:<...>     [ 4th line ]
#     RCPT TO:<...> {...} [ 5th line ]
#     ...
#     <<MAIL-DATA>>
#     ...
#
#    After the '<<MAIL-DATA>>' tag the message follows. The message is
#    composed of a headers section and, after the first empty line, the
#    message body. The format of the RCPT line is:
#
#     RCPT TO:<address> {ra=real-address}
#
#    where "real-address" is the "address" after it has been translated (if
#    aliases applies) to the real local address. Otherwise it holds the same
#    value of "address". In case one or more SMTP filter functionalities are
#    not needed, avoid to create zero sized files altogether, since this will
#    result in faster processing.
