
* Whitelist senders (email address)
* Blacklist senders (email address)

* Blacklist receivers (email address) --> e.g. blacklist all unknown receiver email addresses and only let 
  email to known addresses pass through. (suzanna@ia-schaake.com blacklisted!)
  
* treat bounce messages separately in spamfilters

* graylists / acceptance levels: whitelisted people always pass; then there's the email that passed
  both virus and spam checks, but are either completely 'new' to us (low 'level') or are 'known'
  but not whitelisted (i.e. each of their emails has to pass the tests) (medium 'level', level might
  increase with the number of emails)
  
  The idea is to split the incoming email stream into several categories:
  
  - well-known folks who do not send spam or virusses; 'inner circle'
  
  - known folks, but no special relationship otherwise.
  
  - new entries; may pass at a glance or fully automatically when sufficient trust level is
    achieved regarding our virus and spam filters
    
  - spammers (maybe several levels there, so that we can 'inspect' suspected email and tag
    'false positives' as 'negatives' after all)
  
  - virus carriers

  
* Concept: use CRM114 for spam detection, but ADD another CRM114 to the 'okayed' (negatives) stream to
  help split up our email into several categories (mailing list / friends / urgency detection)
  
* NNTP interface so we can read news like it was email (mailing list) and post to news group as if 
  those were mailing lists (fetchmail interface)
